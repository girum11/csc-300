\section{How the SE Code Applies}
The Code defines software engineers as ``those who contribute by direct participation to the...design, development...of software systems'' \cite{se-code}. Did Eric Butler contribute by ``direct participation'' to the design of some ``software system''?

Firesheep is the name of software written in the C++ programming language that wraps existing packet sniffing software (Wireshark) in an easy to use, one-click GUI extension for the Firefox browser \cite{firesheep}. Firesheep is a software system directly written by Eric Butler, maintained on his open source GitHub account \cite{firesheep-source}. Eric Butler (the software engineer) has therefore contributed by direct participation (programming himself) in the design of a ``software system'' (Firesheep) \cite{firesheep}.

Since he contributed by ``direct participation'' to ``the design'' of a ``software system,'' Eric Butler is considered a ``software engineer'' under the ACM Code of Ethics, and shall appropriately adhere to said Code \cite{se-code}.
